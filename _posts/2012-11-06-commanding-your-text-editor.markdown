> The process of writing code is much different from the process of editing code. It’s easy to confuse the two since they both involve mashing buttons on a keyboard while staring at a computer screen. Vim users know this already. Their editor works in two completely different ways depending on whether they are adding new words to a document or changing existing words. They also know that there’s more to text editing than moving around with the arrow keys and selecting one letter at a time. But you don’t have to memorize hundreds of commands. I think only these six will handle most of the editing that you’ll do every day.








Die beschriebenen Kürzel kenne ich schon länger und kann sie jedem empfehlen. Vor allem Sublime Text Nutzern.
